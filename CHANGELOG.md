# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.0.0 prototype

- Add CLI fixture selection, config JSON/@file, fixture export, and `--dry-run` with temporary
  checkpoints, resume previews, named local-step stubs, immediate durable sleeps, and call reports.
  Local callbacks still run for real. See [workflow rehearsal](docs/rehearsal.md).
- `HarnessRequest.call` now carries durable run/step/attempt/idempotency metadata outside effect
  fingerprints. Use `HarnessRequestInput` for pure `CliHarness.plan()`/direct adapter inputs. Export
  `FixtureHarness`, fixture types/parser, and deterministic schema sampling from the root.
- New records save harness provenance; changing kinds on resume/fork requires `allowHarnessChange` /
  `--allow-harness-change`. Unlabelled format-6 checkpoints remain resumable.
- Ship repository-only real-envelope fake CLIs and an opt-in, zero-cost `test:contract` capture job.

- Persist step/attempt timing, resolved request summaries, usage, stacks, and body executions.
  `ctx.phase` and `ctx.log` provide scoped, replay-marked observations without effect identities.
  Retain 500 event payloads plus compact replay counts. Debug events include time and run ID.
- `workflow inspect` now shows a dashboard; `--json --summary`, `--watch --interval`, and
  `workflow list --status` support monitoring without imports. Watch JSON is JSONL and exits
  0/1/130/3 for completed/failed/cancelled/stale. `-v` prints saved failure stacks.
- **Breaking:** new checkpoints use format 6. Formats 1–5 remain readable but cannot resume or
  supply fork reuse. Step semantic fingerprints are unchanged. Existing `attemptHistory` and
  cancellation status are extended rather than duplicated. Custom contexts must forward phase/log.
- `WorkflowRunError` now exposes `runId` and names the root step/kind in its message, preserving the
  original `cause`. Prompt previews and log data are persisted; treat checkpoints as sensitive. See
  [run observability](docs/observability.md).

- Workflow CLI failures now emit one JSON document with stable error codes, a generated/requested
  run ID, root effect, and the actual saved checkpoint. Typecheck supports `--json`; workflow stdout
  is redirected to stderr in JSON mode. Input accepts inline JSON, `@file`, and `-` for stdin.
- **Breaking:** exit 1 now means a saved workflow failure. Usage, run refusals, and loading errors
  use 2, 3, and 4; storage failures use 74; interrupts use 130. Exit 75 is reserved. Check-resume
  incompatibility now uses exit 3 with its comparison in `error.details`.
- **Breaking:** successfully saved failed/cancelled runs reject with `WorkflowRunError`. Match the
  original error class through `.cause`; `.run` and `.stepId` carry saved context. Existing
  checkpoint aggregates retain the original primary cause. Refusals and input-schema errors now use
  `RunRefusedError` and `WorkflowInputError`. `readRun` still exposes ENOENT for missing files.
- Export `CliErrorCode`, `WorkflowRunError`, `RunRefusedError`, `WorkflowInputError`, and
  `isValidRunId`. Invalid CLI run IDs are rejected before any workflow import.

- Harness calls settle after bounded output draining and reap owned groups on every exit. Cleanup
  grace defaults to 3000ms, settable with `--kill-grace-ms`. SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP first drain; a
  second signal synchronously kills tracked groups and exits 130.
- Durable child ownership prevents abandoned-lock recovery beside live agents. Inspection reports
  owner/process liveness; `--resume --kill-orphans` stops only identity-confirmed groups. Refusals
  use exit 3 (`run.orphans`). See [process lifecycle](docs/process-lifecycle.md) for remaining gaps.
- **Harness port migration:** `invoke` and optional `metadata` now receive `HarnessInvocation` with
  `signal`, run/step/attempt IDs and `trackProcess`, replacing the bare signal parameter. Registry
  persistence failures use `CheckpointError.operation: 'process'`; they cannot retry or become
  settled workflow data. This migration originally retained format 5; the observability epoch above
  now requires format 6.

- Live agents now share a run-wide concurrency cap, defaulting to min(8, max(1, available CPUs -
  2)). Configure total/provider limits through RunOptions or CLI flags, or share a limiter across
  runs. Queueing is cancellable, visible through admission events, and outside per-call deadlines.
  See [agent concurrency](docs/agent-concurrency.md).

- Both harnesses accept shared effort and typed native controls, private role/config files,
  content-snapshotted images and fingerprinted, denylisted args/env/config. Capability controls
  compose with profiles and grants. See [harness controls](docs/harness-controls.md).
- `configuration doctor` now probes native CLI contracts without inference. Runs record CLI versions
  and warn on resumed version changes. The Workflow Lab preserves all 68 original effort settings
  and checks effort alongside prompts and outputs.

- Workflow agent defaults, named profiles, capability manifests, launch grants and sticky
  `--profile` limit overrides are available. See [agent profiles](docs/agent-profiles.md).
- **Privilege change:** Claude `tools` now implies `allowedTools` when omitted. Existing calls that
  expose Edit/Write/Bash may now execute those tools without interactive approval. Workflow runs
  require write/exec grants and default to strict declared profiles. Direct `CliHarness` callers own
  authorization. Explicit allowed rules can narrow the exposed set.
- **Migration:** raw call-site tools/allowedTools/sandbox now require `strictProfiles: false`, plus
  class/all grants for elevated calls. Prefer a declared role. The text preset is now 10 Claude
  turns, $0.50 per call and a five-minute deadline; readonly/edit have larger limits. Custom
  harnesses receive resolved profile options and must enforce them.
- Default empty tool gates and read-only sandbox use canonical omitted identity components. Legacy
  implicit calls retain their format-5 semantic fingerprints; old explicitly spelled default
  components can require a new run/fork. Completed semantic checks are never bypassed.
